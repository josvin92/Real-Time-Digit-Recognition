# Real Time Digit Recognition
* Real Time Digit Recognition app made using pygame, PIL, OpenCV and Keras with tensorflow as backend. 
* MNIST Dataset was used to train a Convolutional Neural Network Model.
* An accuracy of 99.86% was obtained on the test data.
## Dataset
MNIST is a widely used dataset for the hand-written digit classification task. It consists of 70,000 labelled 28x28 pixel grayscale images of hand-written digits. The dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. There are 10 classes (one for each of the 10 digits). The task at hand is to train a model using the 60,000 training images and subsequently test its classification accuracy on the 10,000 test images.<br>

## Sample Images
These are some sample images of the handwritten character from MNIST Dataset. <br><br>

## Instructions
* Run the digit_recog_keras file.
* Write your digit on the pygame black drawing window.
* Wait a second or so and the predicted text will be displayed.
